The series centers on the adventures of a large and diverse cast of characters, headed by the titular character, Homestar Runner. It uses a blend of surreal humor, self-parody, satire, and references to popular culture, particularly video games, classic television, and popular music. The site launched in 2000 and was one of the first websites I would regularly visit as a kid. It has inspired numerous costumes, Halloweens, and even themed parties in my life, and I still think Trogdor is the coolest."
