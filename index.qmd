## About Me
I am a graduate student at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa, where I study pollinators through a biocultural and mutualistic lens. My research focuses on the Hawaiian yellow-faced bee (*Hylaeus*), examining its ecological role, conservation status, and cultural significance within Hawai‘i. I am particularly interested in integrating Indigenous knowledge systems with modern scientific methodologies to develop innovative conservation strategies.

## Background & Training
**Education:**  
  - B.A. in Sustainability Studies, Colorado Mountain College  
  - M.A. (in progress) in Geography & Environment, UH Mānoa  
  - Graduate Certificate in Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Biology (EECB), UH Mānoa  
**Research Focus:** Pollinator conservation, ecosystem mutualisms, GIS applications in ecology  
**Field Experience:** Ecological restoration, cultural site restoration, pollinator surveys, archival research  

## Technical & Analytical Skills
**Statistics & Data Analysis:** Basic experience with ecological data analysis and visualization  
**GIS & Mapping:** Proficient in ArcGIS and QGIS for spatial analysis, cartography, and StoryMapping  
**Programming:** Experience with Python for mapping, minimal SQL  
**Data Collection:** Field-based methods including pollinator sampling, ethnographic interviews, and archival analysis  

## What I Hope to Learn in This Course
I am eager to strengthen my web development skills, particularly in structuring and presenting research findings in an engaging, accessible way. I hope to integrate interactive mapping, data visualization, and dynamic storytelling into my work, making scientific research more publicly accessible and impactful. I also hope to facilitate better the integration of quantitative data into my mixed methods approaches through the use of R.
