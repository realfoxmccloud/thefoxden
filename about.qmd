# 5 Fun Facts About Me

## 1. 🍩 Doughnuts  
I love doughnuts! I eat them everywhere I go, and every culture seems to have a version of fried dough that is absolutely delicious. The picture below is from Holy Donuts, one of my favorites.

## 2. 🚴‍♂️ Cycling  
I bike with Cycle Mānoa at UH and love riding around the island. One of my favorite weekend routines is biking to KCC and doing Diamond Head on Saturdays to catch the farmers market.

## 3. 🦒 Giraffes  
My favorite animal has always been the giraffe. I even have a giraffe skeleton tattoo on my ribs! They’ve fascinated me since I was a kid.

## 4. 🎵 Music  
I’ve been to 30+ music festivals across three continents and two oceans. This picture is from a OMNOM playing a set at a festival —music is a huge part of my life and will continue to be for as long as I can boogie.

## 5. 🎬 Cartoons & Anime  
The *Great Mouse Detective* is still my favorite movie, and cartoons (including anime) have played a huge role in shaping who I am.

# Favorite Website

## [Homestar Runner](https://homestarrunner.com/)

![Homestar Runner and Crew](images/homestar.png)

This is the website for *Homestar Runner*, an American comedy animated web series and website created by Mike and Matt Chapman, known collectively as The Brothers Chaps. The series centers on the adventures of a large and diverse cast of characters, headed by the titular character, Homestar Runner.
It uses a blend of surreal humor, self-parody, satire, and references to popular culture, particularly video games, classic television, and popular music. The site launched in 2000 and was one of the first websites I would regularly visit as a kid.
It has inspired numerous costumes, Halloweens, and even themed parties in my life, and I still think **Trogdor** is the coolest.
